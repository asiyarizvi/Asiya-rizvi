        I completed these posters for my Typography class. The assignment was to
        select a typeface and produce a poster encapsulating the name of the
        creator of the typeface, the year that typeface was created, and any
        forms we found particularly interesting.</p>
      <p>
        My design for the first poster focuses on the f, t, and g. The f and t demonstrate the
        sharpness of of some letters while the g demonstrates an elegantly round
         form while also including a sharp edge towards the top.</p>
      <p>The assignment for the second poster (scroll down) was to experiment with tracking and italics with the same
        typeface as well as include a short bio of the creator.</p>
